### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineering student focused on building robust, scalable systems rather than just shipping features. I believe that understanding the underlying layers—memory management, data structures, and operating systems—is crucial for writing efficient high-level code.

Currently, I use **Fedora Linux** as my daily driver to stay close to the server environment and force myself to master the terminal and system administration.

###  Engineering Philosophy

I am not interested in shortcuts. My goal is to master the fundamentals that outlive frameworks.

**Logic over Syntax:** Languages change, algorithms stay.

**Structure over Speed:** Writing clean, maintainable code (SOLID/Clean Arch) is my priority.

**The Hard Way:** I prefer learning C and raw SQL to understand how things work under the hood before using high-level abstractions.

### Current Study Path

  **Computer Science Fundamentals:** Deep diving into memory allocation and pointers via Harvard's CS50.

  **Backend Architecture:** Studying how to structure APIs that are decoupled and testable.

  **Database Normalization:** Writing raw SQL queries to understand execution plans and optimization.
